## 🧩 My Projects from the Course

### 📘 Project 1: Hospital System Project
Uncover the C++ Hospital System, a powerful project designed to simulate real-world healthcare operations. It manages 20 medical specializations, each with a 5-patient queue, providing structured control over patient admission and doctor interactions.

**🛠️ Features:**
- Multi-Specialization Handling:
Supports up to 20 medical departments, each with a dedicated queue.

- Queue Management:
Efficient patient queuing with dynamic array shifting to manage:

- Regular admissions

- Urgent cases (prioritized at the front)

- Doctor-Patient Interaction:
Allows doctors to pick up patients from their specialization’s queue.

- Patient Information Display:
Neatly prints patient details per specialization, aiding system transparency.

### 📗 Project 2: Library System Project
A console-based application to manage books and users in a small-scale library. It features book search, sorted listings, borrowing/return tracking, and static-capacity storage using arrays.

**🛠️ Features:**

- **Console-Based Menu System**  
  Interactive, menu-driven interface that continuously displays main options after each operation, streamlining admin navigation.

- **Book Data Management**  
  Allows admins to add books, each identified by a unique integer ID, name, and available copy count.

- **Book Search by Name Prefix**  
  Supports flexible book lookups using name prefixes (e.g., searching "Cpp" returns "CppHowToProgram", "CppForDummies").

- **Sorted Book Listings**  
  Enables listing all books sorted either by ID or alphabetically by name.

- **User Data Management**  
  Allows addition of users with unique integer IDs and names for tracking borrowing activity.

- **Book Borrowing Functionality**  
  Users can borrow books only if copies are available. The system reduces the quantity and records the loan per user.

- **Book Return Handling**  
  Increases the available quantity and removes the loan record when a user returns a borrowed book.

- **Borrowed Book Inquiry**  
  Admins can list all users who have borrowed a specific book by providing its name.

- **User Overview with Borrowed Books**  
  Displays all registered users with their IDs, names, and a sorted list of book IDs they have borrowed.

- **Fixed Capacity Storage**  
  Uses static-size arrays (e.g., MAX_BOOKS = 10, MAX_USERS = 10) to manage data, limiting the number of books and users the system can handle.

### 📙 Project 3: Ask Me Project
A terminal-based Q&A system with file persistence, user authentication, threaded discussions, and STL-based data management.

**🛠️ Features:**
- **Persistent Data Storage:**  
  Stores users and questions in `users.txt` and `questions.txt`, auto-loaded and saved using helper functions.

- **User Authentication & Management:**  
  Supports Sign Up, Login, and Sign Out with full user info and anonymous-question option. Users stored in `std::map` for fast access.

- **Question & Answer Functionality:**  
  Users can ask/answer targeted questions (anonymously or not), respecting recipient settings.

- **Threaded Conversation Model:**  
  Supports nested replies with parent-child relationships using `std::map<int, std::vector<int>>`.

- **Comprehensive Views:**  
  View questions "To You", "From You", and global answered question feed.

- **Thread-Aware Deletion:**  
  Users can delete their own questions. Deleting a parent question removes the entire thread.

- **Unique ID Generation:**  
  Each user and question has a unique ID for efficient tracking and referencing.

- **Robust Input Validation:**  
  Ensures safe inputs and prevents unauthorized actions (e.g., deleting others’ questions).

- **Efficient STL Usage:**  
  Uses `std::map` and `std::vector` for scalable, fast data operations (O(log N)).

- **Concurrency Limitation (Acknowledged):**  
  Parallel users may receive same IDs due to non-thread-safe generation — noted for future improvement.

### 📕 Project 4: OOing AskMe System Project
A complete object-oriented refactoring of the original AskMe system, transforming struct-based procedural code into a fully encapsulated, modular architecture. This advanced Q&A platform demonstrates professional OOP principles while maintaining all original functionality with significantly improved maintainability and extensibility.

**🛠️ Features:**

- **Complete OOP Architecture Transformation:**  
  Full refactoring from struct-based design to proper class hierarchies with strict private/public encapsulation, eliminating procedural dependencies and implementing clean object-oriented design patterns.

- **Multi-Manager Class System:**  
  Implements specialized manager classes (`UsersManager`, `QuestionsManager`) alongside core entities (`User`, `Question`), each with single responsibility and minimal coupling for maximum maintainability.

- **Advanced Threaded Discussion Architecture:**  
  Sophisticated conversation threading using `std::map<Question*, std::vector<Question*>>` for efficient parent-child relationships, supporting unlimited nested replies with O(log N) access complexity.

- **Encapsulated User Management System:**  
  Complete user lifecycle with private data members, controlled access through getters, authentication validation, and configurable privacy settings for anonymous question handling.

- **Object-Oriented File Persistence:**  
  Dedicated file I/O operations encapsulated within manager classes, maintaining data integrity across sessions with automatic loading/saving and proper error handling.

- **Professional Memory Management:**  
  Robust constructor/destructor implementation with RAII principles, dynamic memory allocation for scalable collections, and proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

- **Enhanced Input Validation & Safety:**  
  Comprehensive bounds checking, null pointer validation, user permission verification, and graceful error recovery with informative feedback messages.

- **Modular File Architecture:**  
  Clean separation across multiple files with organized namespaces (`inAndOutFiles`, `Utils`), proper header guards, and logical component grouping for professional codebase structure.

- **Const-Correct Implementation:**  
  Extensive use of const parameters and methods where data shouldn't be modified, following modern C++ best practices for compile-time safety and optimization.

- **View-Model Separation:**  
  Clear architectural distinction between business logic (model classes) and presentation layer (display methods), implementing MVC-like patterns for better code organization.

- **STL-Driven Data Management:**  
  Heavy utilization of Standard Template Library containers with proper iterators, algorithms, and modern C++ idioms for efficient and readable code.

- **Intelligent ID Generation System:**  
  Smart auto-incrementing identifier system that parses existing file data to generate unique IDs for users and questions, preventing conflicts and maintaining data consistency.

- **Thread-Safe Design Foundation:**  
  Architecture designed with future concurrency in mind, using proper encapsulation and access patterns that can easily accommodate multi-threading enhancements.
