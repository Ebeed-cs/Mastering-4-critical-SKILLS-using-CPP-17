## 🧩 My Projects from the Course

### 📘 Project 1: Hospital System Project
Uncover the C++ Hospital System, a powerful project designed to simulate real-world healthcare operations. It manages 20 medical specializations, each with a 5-patient queue, providing structured control over patient admission and doctor interactions.

**🛠️ Features:**
- Multi-Specialization Handling:
Supports up to 20 medical departments, each with a dedicated queue.

- Queue Management:
Efficient patient queuing with dynamic array shifting to manage:

- Regular admissions

- Urgent cases (prioritized at the front)

- Doctor-Patient Interaction:
Allows doctors to pick up patients from their specialization’s queue.

- Patient Information Display:
Neatly prints patient details per specialization, aiding system transparency.

### 📗 Project 2: Library System Project
A console-based application to manage books and users in a small-scale library. It features book search, sorted listings, borrowing/return tracking, and static-capacity storage using arrays.

**🛠️ Features:**

- **Console-Based Menu System**  
  Interactive, menu-driven interface that continuously displays main options after each operation, streamlining admin navigation.

- **Book Data Management**  
  Allows admins to add books, each identified by a unique integer ID, name, and available copy count.

- **Book Search by Name Prefix**  
  Supports flexible book lookups using name prefixes (e.g., searching "Cpp" returns "CppHowToProgram", "CppForDummies").

- **Sorted Book Listings**  
  Enables listing all books sorted either by ID or alphabetically by name.

- **User Data Management**  
  Allows addition of users with unique integer IDs and names for tracking borrowing activity.

- **Book Borrowing Functionality**  
  Users can borrow books only if copies are available. The system reduces the quantity and records the loan per user.

- **Book Return Handling**  
  Increases the available quantity and removes the loan record when a user returns a borrowed book.

- **Borrowed Book Inquiry**  
  Admins can list all users who have borrowed a specific book by providing its name.

- **User Overview with Borrowed Books**  
  Displays all registered users with their IDs, names, and a sorted list of book IDs they have borrowed.

- **Fixed Capacity Storage**  
  Uses static-size arrays (e.g., MAX_BOOKS = 10, MAX_USERS = 10) to manage data, limiting the number of books and users the system can handle.

### 📙 Project 3: Ask Me Project
A console-based question-and-answer system with persistent file storage, user authentication, threaded discussions, and smart data handling using STL.

**🛠️ Features:**
- Persistent storage via `users.txt` and `questions.txt`  
- Sign Up / Login / Sign Out with username-based lookups using `std::map`  
- Ask/answer questions with support for anonymity and user preferences  
- Threaded conversation model with reply chains  
- View questions: received, sent, or all answered feed  
- Delete own questions, including entire thread if parent is removed  
- Unique IDs for users and questions  
- Strong input validation and error handling  
- Efficient data structures: `std::map` and `std::vector`  
- Acknowledged limitation: concurrent ID conflicts in parallel sessions
